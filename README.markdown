# üåå Introduction

This project dives into the Uber Fares Dataset to uncover the dynamics of ride fares, trip distances, and temporal patterns. By leveraging Python for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, we create an interactive dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable insights. This analysis empowers stakeholders to understand Uber‚Äôs operational landscape and optimize pricing, driver allocation, and market expansion strategies.

### üéØ Objectives
- **Understand**: Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to grasp dataset structure and quality.  
- **Prepare**: Clean and enhance the dataset for robust analysis.  
- **Analyze**: Uncover relationships between fares, distances, and temporal factors.  
- **Visualize**: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to showcase trends.  
- **Recommend**: Provide data-driven insights to improve Uber‚Äôs operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Analytical Workflow

### 1. üì° Data Understanding and Preparation
- **Download**: Sourced the Uber Fares Dataset from Kaggle, a comprehensive collection of ride data.  
- **Load**: Imported the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using Python.  
- **Explore**: Performed comprehensive EDA to assess dataset structure, dimensions, data types, and initial quality.  
- **Clean**: Handled missing values, filtered unrealistic fares, and validated coordinates.  
- **Export**: Saved the cleaned dataset as `uber.csv` for Power BI import.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Display settings
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)

# Load the Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("uber.csv")
print("Dataset loaded successfully.")
df.head()

# Explore the Dataset
print("Shape of the dataset:", df.shape)
print("\nData Types and Missing Values:")
print(df.info())
print("\nSummary Statistics:")
print(df.describe())
print("\nMissing Values Count:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Clean the Data
# Drop rows with missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

# Filter out unrealistic fare amounts and coordinates
df_cleaned = df_cleaned[
    (df_cleaned['fare_amount'] > 0) &
    (df_cleaned['fare_amount'] < 200) &
    (df_cleaned['pickup_latitude'].between(-90, 90)) &
    (df_cleaned['pickup_longitude'].between(-180, 180))
]

print("Cleaned dataset shape:", df_cleaned.shape)
df_cleaned.head()

# Feature Engineering
# Convert pickup_datetime to datetime type
df_cleaned['pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_cleaned['pickup_datetime'])

# Extract time features
df_cleaned['hour'] = df_cleaned['pickup_datetime'].dt.hour
df_cleaned['day'] = df_cleaned['pickup_datetime'].dt.day
df_cleaned['month'] = df_cleaned['pickup_datetime'].dt.month
df_cleaned['day_of_week'] = df_cleaned['pickup_datetime'].dt.dayofweek

# Add peak/off-peak label
def is_peak(hour):
    return 'Peak' if 7 <= hour <= 9 or 17 <= hour <= 19 else 'Off-Peak'

df_cleaned['peak'] = df_cleaned['hour'].apply(is_peak)

df_cleaned.head()

# Export the Cleaned Dataset
df_cleaned.to_csv("uber.csv", index=False)
print("Cleaned dataset saved as 'uber.csv'")
print(df_cleaned.describe())
```

**Why this?**

This script loads the Uber dataset, performs EDA to understand its structure and quality, cleans it by removing invalid data, and enriches it with temporal features. The cleaned dataset is saved for Power BI import, ensuring a solid foundation for analysis.

### 2. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Generated mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, and ranges, identifying outliers in fare and distance.  
- **Visualizations**: Created plots to analyze fare distribution and relationships.  
- **Relationships**: Explored correlations between fare amount, distance, and time of day.

#### a. Descriptive Statistics
- **üîç Insight**: Fares are right-skewed, with most under $20; outliers indicate surge pricing or long trips.  
- **üí° Impact**: Highlights the prevalence of short, affordable rides.

```python
print(df_cleaned.describe())
```

#### b. Fare and Distance Distribution
- **üîç Insight**: Most rides are short, with fares under $20, but outliers suggest surge pricing or long-distance trips.  
- **üí° Impact**: Guides pricing strategies and anomaly detection.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.boxplot(y=df_cleaned['fare_amount'])
plt.title('Boxplot of Fare Amount')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.boxplot(y=df_cleaned['distance'])
plt.title('Boxplot of Distance')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
- **Output**:
![Fare and Distance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1086d0d6-96c1-4515-8de6-857810a9eac2)

#### c. Fare Range Analysis ($0‚Äì$100)
- **üîç Insight**: Fares predominantly fall in the $5‚Äì$10 range, with frequency decreasing as fares rise.  
- **üí° Impact**: Reinforces Uber‚Äôs appeal for affordable rides, informing promotional strategies.

```python
reasonable_fares = df_cleaned[(df_cleaned['fare_amount'] > 0) & (df_cleaned['fare_amount'] <= 100)]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(reasonable_fares['fare_amount'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Uber Fare Amounts (0 to $100)')
plt.xlabel('Fare Amount ($)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```
- **Output**:
![Fare Range](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39324b1f-a798-4fe6-8a21-f6dac9aa2251)

#### d. Relationships: Fare vs. Distance & Hourly Trends
- **üîç Scatter Plot Insight**: A linear relationship confirms distance as a primary fare driver.  
- **üîç Boxplot Insight**: Evening hours show wider fare variability, likely due to surge pricing.  
- **üí° Impact**: Validates pricing models and suggests dynamic driver allocation during peak hours.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))

# Fare amount vs. distance
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.scatter(reasonable_fares['distance'], reasonable_fares['fare_amount'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Fare Amount vs. Distance')
plt.xlabel('Distance (km)')
plt.ylabel('Fare Amount ($)')

# Fare amount vs. hour of the day
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.boxplot(x=reasonable_fares['hour'], y=reasonable_fares['fare_amount'])
plt.title('Fare Amount vs. Hour of the Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day')
plt.ylabel('Fare Amount ($)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
- **Output**:
